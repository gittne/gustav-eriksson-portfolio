    <h1 align="center">Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>
    <h2 align="center">About me:</h2>
    <p align="center">
        Thank you for visiting my website! Programmed it myself with HTML and CSS. Pretty neat, huh? But enough about that, let me introduce myself!
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is Gustav. I'm a 22 year old student at Södertörn University, currently studying the third year in their Game Development Program, Design and Scripting.
        This means that I've learnt a lot of the programming and design aspects of game development, as well as always getting along with anyone I work with (teamwork makes the dreamwork after all.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've always had an intereset in how games are made, and how games can be used to tell unique narratives and create emotional experiences.
        I have experience with C# programming, narrative design, and game design. I also have experience with photo manipulation in GIMP/Photoshop.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you'd like to contact me you can find my contact information, as well as a link to my itch page, at the bottom of this page.
        Hopefully you'll look through my body of work in the meantime :)

    <h2 align="center">Diener Dates</h2>
    <p align="center">
        The latest game I worked on, which got nominated at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gameawards.se/nominees-2023">Swedish Game Awards</a> for Diversity.
        It's a dating visual novel where the player runs a diner in the afterlife and take care of the customers who visit the diner. The main theme of our game is LGBTQ+ friendly characters, as they all identify somewhere in the LGBTQ+ spectrum.
        This was made in a little over 3 months as part of a course at Södertörn University. I worked on the shop system, a little bit of the effects, helped with the layout of the diner with the graphics-team, and did writing for a couple of the characters.

    <h2 align="center">Silver Lining</h2>
    <p align="center">
        The first ever FPS I worked on. It's a little rough around the edges, but had a ton of fun making this.
        I worked on the shooting and enemy placements.

    <h2 align="center"> Chinese Checkers </h2>
    <p align="center">
        Part of our Game Programming II course. We were tasked with creating chinese checkers with a fully functional AI within Unity. It was a lot to take in,
        but a lot of C# programming was learnt during that course.

    <h2 align="center"> Where did Megan go? </h2>
    <p align="center">
        A game I did as part of the Narrative Design course. We were tasked with creating a narrative driven game with a set amount of words to describe the narrative.
        This meant using a lot of environmental storytelling and items the player can pick up to tell a story. Was a lot of fun coming up with the narrative and how to work around the word limit.

        A pacman clone we did as part of a course at Södertörn University. I worked on the character movement, camera controls, and part of the power-ups.
