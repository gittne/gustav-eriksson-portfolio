    <h1 align="center">Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>
    <h2 align="center">About me:</h2>
    <p align="center">
        Thank you for visiting my website! Programmed it myself with HTML and CSS. Pretty neat, huh? But enough about that, let me introduce myself!
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is Gustav. I'm a 22 year old student at Södertörn University, currently studying the third year in their Game Development Program, Design and Scripting.
        This means that I've learnt a lot of the programming and design aspects of game development, as well as always getting along with anyone I work with (teamwork makes the dreamwork after all).
        <br />
        <br />
        I've always had an intereset in how games are made, and how games can be used to tell unique narratives and create emotional experiences.
        I have experience with C# programming, narrative design, and game design. I also have experience with photo manipulation in GIMP/Photoshop.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you'd like to contact me you can find my contact information, as well as a link to my itch page, at the bottom of this page.
        Hopefully you'll look through my body of work in the meantime :)
    
    <h2 align="center">Diener Dates</h2>
    <p align="center">
        The latest game I worked on, which got nominated at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gameawards.se/nominees-2023">Swedish Game Awards</a> for Diversity.
        It's a dating visual novel where the player runs a diner in the afterlife and take care of the customers who visit the diner. The main theme of our game is LGBTQ+ friendly characters, as they all identify somewhere in the LGBTQ+ spectrum.
        This was made in a little over 3 months as part of a course at Södertörn University. I worked on the shop system, a little bit of the effects, helped with the layout of the diner with the graphics-team, and did writing for a couple of the characters.

    <h2 align="center">Silver Lining</h2>
    <p align="center">
        The first ever FPS I worked on. It's a little rough around the edges, but had a ton of fun making this.
        I came with the idea to create a FPS with a psychological horror twist at the end, with me also doing the shooting and helping with enemy placement.
        Although the execution could be better, it is still something I'm happy I've done, and something I wish could be iterated on further in the future.

    <h2 align="center"> Chinese Checkers </h2>
    <p align="center">
        Part of our Game Programming II course. We were tasked with creating chinese checkers with a fully functional AI within Unity. It was a lot to take in,
        but a lot of C# programming was learnt during that course.

    <h2 align="center"> Where did Megan go? </h2>
    <p align="center">
        A game I did as part of the Narrative Design course. We were tasked with creating a narrative driven game with a set amount of words to describe the narrative.
        This meant using a lot of environmental storytelling and items the player can pick up to tell a story. Was a lot of fun coming up with the narrative and how to work around the word limit.

        A pacman clone we did as part of a course at Södertörn University. I worked on the character movement, camera controls, and part of the power-ups.

    <p align="center">
        The first ever game I worked on. We were tasked with creating a tower defense game as part of a course at Södertörn University.
        I worked on the towers and some of the enemy's functions.
